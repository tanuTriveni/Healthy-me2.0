                                    This type of scheme was implemented to help the families who live below the poverty line. It covers the medical expenses of each and every member of the family. In case of death due to an accident, there is a cover that is provided.
The main drivers of the Universal Health Insurance Scheme are basically the four public sector general insurance companies who have been doing this with an aim of improving healthcare to the underprivileged and especially the economically disabled citizen in India.
Once a family member is hospitalized, this scheme may facilitate the medical expenses of up to 30,000 rupees. However, when the earning head of the family is admitted to the hospital, the Universal health insurance scheme compensates a total of 50 rupees daily for a maximum of 15 days.
We can therefore say that this insurance scheme is designed for families below the poverty line.

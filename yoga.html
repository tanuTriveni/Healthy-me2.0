        <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h2>Hatha Yoga</h2>
        <img class="imgs" src="images/yoga/hatt yoga.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>The Sanskrit word Hatha means “force.” Therefore, hatha yoga restores the balance of the body. This type of yoga works on the harmony between the chakras and energy points. The chakras are vortexes of energy or the points in our body where the energy lies concentrated. They are present in seven different locations in the body and connect to specific organs and glands.
            Hatha yoga comprises many physical postures and positions that balance the body and mind. Different types of yoga by various schools and teachers have certain fundamental commonalities.
            Research shows that Hatha yoga helps us destress, stay physically fit and agile, and make us look younger. In addition, Hatha yoga purifies and heals our system. Also, sustained practice leads to weight loss and toned muscles.
            </p>
        <h3>The different types of yoga forms borne out of hatha yoga are:</h3>
        <h2>Ashtanga Yoga</h2>
        <p>Ashtanga yoga is a direct offshoot of sage Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras. Famous as the yoga form for weight loss, the ashtanga word is a derivative of the word eight in Sanskrit. 
            Ashtanga yoga has eight pillars: Principles, personal discipline, asana and postures, pranayama, withdrawal, concentration, meditation and salvation.
            </p>
        <h4 class="list">Some of the common different types of asanas practiced in ashtanga yoga are:</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Padmasana</li>
            <li>Simhasan</li>
            <li>The Butterfly</li>
            <li>Kapalbhati pranayama</li>
            <li>Anulom vilom pranayama</li>
            <li>Surya bhedi pranayama</li>
            <li>Chandra bhedi pranayama</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h2>Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
        <img class="imgs" src="images/yoga/vinayas yoga.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>This form of yoga is also called “flow” yoga. The word “Vinyasa” has two parts, with Vi meaning variation and Nyasa meaning within prescribed limits.
            Vinyasa yoga incorporates movement and breathing techniques. It creates a flow of postures with controlled breathing replicating the flow of life. For example, Vinyasa yogis initiate the flow with a child’s pose and terminate the flow with the death pose (the savasana). The transitions into each posture reflect the movement through life.Vinyasa yoga is a good choice for the ones who like high-intensity exercises. In addition, Vinyasa yoga is ideal for anxiety, depression, blood pressure and sleep.</p>
        
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h2>Kundalini Yoga</h2>
        <img class="imgs" src="images/yoga/kundali yoga.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>Also known as the “yoga of awareness,” kundalini yoga includes repetitive poses. Kundalini yoga awakens the latent kundalini Shakti. This spiritual energy resides at the base of the spine. Yogis believe that Kundalini Shakti is like a coiled snake, unaroused at the base of the spine. Therefore, the active energy moves up the spine and contributes to your spiritual well-being. Kundalini yoga is also suitable for stress, anxiety, depression and better cognitive function.
            Movements begin with a chant, followed by pranayama, the act of controlled and precise breathing. Then comes kriya, a set of postures or mudras (specific hand positioning). Then one performs pranayama, chanting, and meditation.
            Jal neti kriya is a cleansing technique that helps remove mucus and other blockages from the nasal passage.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Iyengar Yoga</h2>
        <p>This type of yoga is quite similar to vinyasa yoga. It gets its name from B.K.S. Iyengar, one of the foremost yoga teachers in the world. Iyengar yoga is different from other types of yoga. It focuses primarily on posture, body alignment and opening of the body. It also uses props such as yoga blocks and belts to perfect poses</p>

In addition, it has shown visible results in treating disabilities of the spine. The development of strength, mobility and stability is progressive. It also helps in curing gynaecological and gastroenterological diseases.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Aerial Yoga</h2>
        <p>It is suitable not only for advanced people but also for beginners. It helps to build toned and lean muscles. As opposed to traditional yoga, aerial yoga also incorporates other exercises-all while defying gravity. It has the goodness of yoga and cardio exercises like swimming or running.
            In this particular yoga, a rope suspends our body in the air, and poses are introduced hereafter.

        </h1>
        <h2>Karma Yoga</h2>
        <p>Karma yoga is one’s path of devotion to selfless work. In other words, it is a yoga of action. It signifies that one has to devote time, energy, and effort to any task.

            </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Jana Yoga</h2>
        <p>Jnana yoga is the yoga of intellectual knowledge and practical wisdom. This form is all about self-realisation through meditative awareness. One experiences knowledge and develops intuitive understanding. One learns to separate the ego from the true Self.
            Jnana yoga comprises three main stages:
            	Sravana (hearing or exposing oneself to knowledge),
            	Manana (thinking and revisiting the wisdom for enhanced understanding),
            	Nididhyasana (meditation).
            Jnana yoga may not be physically challenging, but it is one of the most challenging forms of yoga to practice, as it requires an open mind.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Raja Yoga</h2>
        <p>Raja Yoga means king in Sanskrit. Raja Yoga is also known as ‘classical yoga’, ‘king of yogis’ or ‘yoga of the mind’. It is also called ashtanga yoga. 
            The word ashtanga alludes to the number eight, and ashtanga yoga also comprises of eight steps:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Yama (Principles)
                    </li>
                <li>Niyama (Personal Discipline)</li>
                <li>Asana (Positions and Postures)</li>
                <li>Pranayama (Breathing Practices)</li>
                <li>Pratyahara (Withdrawal)</li>
                <li>Dharana (Concentration)</li>
                <li>Dhyan (Meditation)</li>
                <li>Samadhi (Salvation)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Asanas can be practised and polished over time to achieve perfection. For example, some of the common asanas practised in ashtanga yoga are Padmasana (the lotus pose), Simhasana (the lion pose), Bhadrasana (the butterfly pose, etc.).
            Many breathing exercises or pranayamas, like Kapalbhati, Anulom Vilom, Surya Bhedi, Chandra Bhedi, etc., make it suitable to combat day to day stress. Raja yoga is perfect for you if you want yoga for anxiety, stress relief, or back pain.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Bhakti Yoga</h1>
        <p>Bhakti comes from bhaj, which means to worship or love God. Some people consider bhakti-yoga a way to liberate themselves from the eternal birth and death cycle. Treading this spiritual path helps unite one’s soul or ‘atman’ with Brahman or ‘true reality.’
            Depending on the type of Bhakti you choose to follow, you identify as a particular type of devotee or bhakt.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Artha – distressed one
                    </li>
                <li>Artharthi – one who wants materialistic wealth</li>

                <li>Jnani – the self-aware one</li>
